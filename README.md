# Predicting Bike Sharing Rides

The goal of this project is to build model to predict daily bike rental ridership so bike rental can prepare optimal number of bikes on daily basis.
Neural network with tuned hyperparameters was used to fit the mode based on historical data analyzed and prepared with One-Hot Encoding and normalization using Python.  

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
